Welcome to openpilot
======

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driving agent.

Currently it performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) for Hondas and Acuras. It's about on par with Tesla Autopilot at launch, and better than [all other manufacturers](http://www.thedrive.com/tech/5707/the-war-for-autonomous-driving-part-iii-us-vs-germany-vs-japan).

The openpilot codebase has been written to be concise and enable rapid prototyping. We look forward to your contributions - improving real vehicle automation has never been easier.

Here are [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OwTJFuDI7g) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64Wvt5pYQmE) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IW7Nejsr3A) [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VN1YcC83nA) [running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQJZvVeihZk). And a really cool [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwOnsT2UW5o).

Hardware
------

Right now openpilot supports the [NEO research platform](http://github.com/commaai/neo) and the [EON Dashcam DevKit](https://shop.comma.ai/products/eon-dashcam-devkit). We'd like to support other platforms as well.

Install openpilot on a neo device by entering ``https://openpilot.comma.ai`` during NEOS setup.

Supported Cars
------

- Acura ILX 2016 with AcuraWatch Plus
  - Due to use of the cruise control for gas, it can only be enabled above 25 mph

- Honda Civic 2016-2017 with Honda Sensing
  - Due to limitations in steering firmware, steering is disabled below 12 mph
  - Note that the hatchback model is not supported

- Honda CR-V Touring 2015-2016
  - Can only be enabled above 25 mph

- Toyota RAV-4 2016+ with TSS-P (alpha!)
  - Can only be enabled above 20 mph

In Progress Cars
------

- Toyota Prius 2017

- Probably all TSS-P Toyota

Community Ported Cars
------

- Chevy Volt 2016-2018 Premier with Driver Confidence II

- Classic Tesla Model S (pre-AP)

To understand how the services interact, see `selfdrive/service_list.yaml`

Testing on PC
------

There is rudimentary infrastructure to run a basic simulation and generate a report of openpilot's behavior in different scenarios.

```bash
# Requires working docker
./run_docker_tests.sh
```

The results are written to `selfdrive/test/plant/out/index.html`

More extensive testing infrastructure and simulation environments are coming soon.

Adding Car Support
------

comma.ai offers [bounties](http://comma.ai/bounties.html) for adding additional car support.

CR-V Touring support came in through this program. Chevy Volt is close. Accord is close as well.

User Data / chffr Account / Crash Reporting
------

By default openpilot creates an account and includes a client for chffr, our dashcam app. We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

It's open source software, so you are free to disable it if you wish. 

It logs the road facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
It does not log the user facing camera or the microphone.

By using it, you agree to [our privacy policy](https://beta.comma.ai/privacy.html). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma.ai. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma.ai for the use of this data.
